- [here is the subreddit for this](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/)
- [here is how to debug this](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/comments/73dvty/tutorial_how_to_create_and_livedebug_userchromecss/)

### How to install

- Type this is address bar - `about:config`
- Search for this `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and set it to true.
- Type this in the address bar - `about:support` 
- Now search for `Profile Directory`, this is where you have to create a folder named `chrome` and put the `useChrome.css` and `useContent.css` there.
- Use some dracula theme, so some elements looks same.

### Notes

- my config is not complete, i.e. you will not find all the ui look same.
- most firefox css you will find on net will be broken unless it is actively maintained. The reason being that firefox is constantly updating its UI.
- this also applies to themes, most themes are broken, if they are not updated
- if you have some question you can post it on the subreddit given above
